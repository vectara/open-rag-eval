f24d1e15-972b-4866-8ef2-d5d7bbf378bb,What is scorched earth strategy?,[4],"Scorched earth - In World War I, Imperial Russian army forces created a zone of destruction by using a large-scale scorched-earth strategy during their retreat from the German army in the summer/autumn of 1915. The Russian troops, retreating along a front of more than 600 miles, destroyed anything that might be of use to their enemy, including crops, houses, railways and entire cities. They also forcibly removed huge numbers of people. In pushing the Russians back to their homeland, the German army gained a large area of territory from the Russian Empire (in an area that is today Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia and Lithuania).",

""separateness"") was a system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. Apartheid was characterised by an authoritarian political culture based on ""baasskap"" (or white supremacy), which encouraged state repression of Black African, Coloured, and Asian South Africans for the benefit of the nation's minority white population. The economic legacy and social effects of apartheid continue to the present day.","Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s[1]. It was characterized by an authoritarian political culture based on ""baasskap"" or white supremacy, which encouraged state repression of Black African, Coloured, and Asian South Africans for the benefit of the nation's minority white population[1]. Apartheid was delineated into ""petty apartheid"", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and ""grand apartheid"", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race[2]. The state passed laws that paved the way for ""grand apartheid"", which was centered on separating races on a large scale, by compelling people to live in separate places defined by race[3]. Apartheid sparked significant international and domestic opposition, resulting in some of the most influential global social movements of the twentieth century[5]."
9411f7a2-aa9e-4d0e-8a11-f98382558556,What was apartheid?,[2],"Apartheid - Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into ""petty apartheid"", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and ""grand apartheid"", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some aspects of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by White South Africans and the socially enforced separation of Black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid was adopted as a formal policy by the South African government after the election of the National Party (NP) at the 1948 general election.",

This strategy was in part adopted from ""left-over"" British rule that separated different racial groups after they took control of the Boer republics in the Anglo-Boer war. This created the black-only ""townships"" or ""locations"", where blacks were relocated to their own towns. In addition, ""petty apartheid"" laws were passed. The principal apartheid laws were as follows.",
9411f7a2-aa9e-4d0e-8a11-f98382558556,What was apartheid?,[4],"Apartheid - Apartheid developed from the racism of colonial factions and due to South Africa's ""unique industrialization"". The policies of industrialization led to segregation of and classing of people, which was ""specifically developed to nurture early industry such as mining"". Cheap labour was the basis of the economy and this was taken from what the state classed as peasant groups and the migrants. Furthermore, Philip Bonner highlights the ""contradictory economic effects"" as the economy did not have a manufacturing sector, therefore promoting short term profitability but limiting labour productivity and the size of local markets. This also led to its collapse as ""Clarkes emphasises the economy could not provide and compete with foreign rivals as they failed to master cheap labour and complex chemistry"".",
9411f7a2-aa9e-4d0e-8a11-f98382558556,What was apartheid?,[5],"Apartheid - Apartheid sparked significant international and domestic opposition, resulting in some of the most influential global social movements of the twentieth century. It was the target of frequent condemnation in the United Nations and brought about an extensive arms and trade embargo on South Africa. During the 1970s and 1980s, internal resistance to apartheid became increasingly militant, prompting brutal crackdowns by the National Party government and protracted sectarian violence that left thousands dead or in detention. Some reforms of the apartheid system were undertaken, including allowing for Indian and Coloured political representation in parliament, but these measures failed to appease most activist groups.",
26ab72e4-8536-45d8-a2aa-de6082417d0f,What can we learn with microbiology?,[1],"Diagnostic microbiology - Diagnostic microbiology is the study of microbial identification. Since the discovery of the germ theory of disease, scientists have been finding ways to harvest specific organisms. Using methods such as differential media or genome sequencing, physicians and scientists can observe novel functions in organisms for more effective and accurate diagnosis of organisms. Methods used in diagnostic microbiology are often used to take advantage of a particular difference in organisms attain information about what species it might be, often through a reference of previous studies. New studies provide information that other scientists can reference back to so scientists can have a baseline knowledge of the organism he or she are working with.","We can learn about the study of microorganisms, those being unicellular (single cell), multicellular (cell colony), or acellular (lacking cells) with microbiology. Microbiology encompasses numerous sub-disciplines including virology, parasitology, mycology and bacteriology. Diagnostic microbiology is the study of microbial identification, using methods such as differential media or genome sequencing to observe novel functions in organisms for more effective and accurate diagnosis[1][3]. Medical microbiologists study the characteristics of pathogens, their modes of transmission, mechanisms of infection and growth to devise a treatment and serve as consultants for physicians[4]. The field of microbiology can be divided into pure microbiology and applied microbiology (biotechnology), where organisms are studied on a deeper theoretical level[5]."
