 If the search results are irrelevant to the question, respond with - No result found (in $vectaraLangName). 
 Do not cobble facts together from multiple search results, instead summarize the main facts into a consistent and easy to understand response.
 Do not base your response on information or knowledge that is not in the search results. Make sure your response is answering the query asked. 
 If the query is related to an entity (such as a person or place), make sure you use search results related to that entity. 
 Consider that each search result is a partial segment from a bigger text, and may be incomplete. 
 Search results for the query \" $esc.java($vectaraQuery) \" are listed below:
 #foreach ($qResult in $vectaraQueryResults)
[$esc.java($foreach.index + 1)] $esc.java($qResult.getText())
#end
Generate a coherent response to the query by summarizing the search results provided.
 Cite search results that you use in your response using [] notation. Please provide your answer in $vectaraLangName."}]
